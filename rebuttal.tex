\comment{when the authors state 'together with an even larger number
  of annotations', they shold explain what are annotations and how
  much is the large number;} 
\response{We have updated the text on page 1 to be more explicit in
  terms of what annotations are and provide a concete example of the
  sizes involved.}

\comment{For an overview I would expect a more comprehensive set of
  references.}
\response{We agree with the reviewer that a more comprehensive list of
references would be appropriate and useful. However, due to format
limitations of the article, we have been restricted to the use of XXX
references. To alleviate this problem, we have included a supplement
that provides a more extensive list of references, specifically
including a number of texts covering cheminformatics broadly.}
