	Abstract = {Chemoinformatics is a large scientific discipline that deals with
	the storage, organization, management, retrieval, analysis, dissemination,
	visualization, and use of chemical information. Chemoinformatics
	techniques are used extensively in drug discovery and development.
	Although many consider it a mature field, the advent of high-throughput
	experimental techniques and the need to analyze very large data sets
	have brought new life and challenges to it. Here, we review a selection
	of papers published in 2006 that caught our attention with regard
	to the novelty of the methodology that was presented. The field is
	seeing significant growth, which will be further catalyzed by the
	widespread availability of public databases to support the development
	and validation of new approaches.},

@article{cokfl06,
	Abstract = {SMILES strings and other classic 2D structural formats offer a convenient
	way to represent molecules as a simplistic connection table, with
	the inherent advantages of ease of handling and storage. In the context
	of virtual screening, chemical databases to be screened are often
	initially represented by canonicalised SMILES strings that can be
	filtered and pre-processed in a number of ways, resulting in molecules
	that occupy similar regions of chemical space to active compounds
	of a therapeutic target. A wide variety of software exists to convert
	molecules into SMILES format, namely, Mol2smi (Daylight Inc.), MOE
	(Chemical Computing Group) and Babel (Openeye Scientific Software).
	Depending on the algorithm employed, the atoms of a SMILES string
	defining a molecule can be ordered differently. Upon conversion to
	3D coordinates they result in the production of ostensibly the same
	molecule.In this work we show how different permutations of a SMILES
	string can affect conformer generation, affecting reliability and
	repeatability of the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel procedure
	for the generation of conformers, taking advantage of the permutation
	of the input strings--both SMILES and other 2D formats, leading to
	more effective sampling of conformation space in output, and also
	implementing fingerprint and principal component analyses step to
	post process and visualise the results.},

	Abstract = {Ligand docking is a widely used approach in virtual screening. In
	recent years a large number of publications have appeared in which
	docking tools are compared and evaluated for their effectiveness
	in virtual screening against a wide variety of protein targets. These
	studies have shown that the effectiveness of docking in virtual screening
	is highly variable due to a large number of possible confounding
	factors. Another class of method that has shown promise in virtual
	screening is the shape-based, ligand-centric approach. Several direct
	comparisons of docking with the shape-based tool ROCS have been conducted
	using data sets from some of these recent docking publications. The
	results show that a shape-based, ligand-centric approach is more
	consistent than, and often superior to, the protein-centric approach
	taken by docking.},

	Abstract = {The growing consensus that most valuable data source for biomedical
	discoveries is derived from human samples is clearly reflected in
	the growing number of translational medicine and translational sciences
	departments across pharma as well as academic and government supported
	initiatives such as Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA)
	in the US and the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of EU with emphasis
	on translating research for human health.The pharmaceutical companies
	of Johnson and Johnson have established translational and biomarker
	departments and implemented an effective knowledge management framework
	including building a data warehouse and the associated data mining
	applications. The implemented resource is built from open source
	systems such as i2b2 and GenePattern.The system has been deployed
	across multiple therapeutic areas within the pharmaceutical companies
	of Johnson and Johnsons and being used actively to integrate and
	mine internal and public data to support drug discovery and development
	decisions such as indication selection and trial design in a translational
	medicine setting. Our results show that the established system allows
	scientist to quickly re-validate hypotheses or generate new ones
	with the use of an intuitive graphical interface.The implemented
	resource can serve as the basis of precompetitive sharing and mining
	of studies involving samples from human subjects thus enhancing our
	understanding of human biology and pathophysiology and ultimately
	leading to more effective treatment of diseases which represent unmet
	medical needs.},
